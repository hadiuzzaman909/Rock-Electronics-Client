                                    JavaScript is a lightweight and powerful interpreted language used for client-side scripting; it runs on all browsers. Node JS, on the flip side, is a server-side language that runs on the V8 engine only.JavaScript can be run on any browser that supports the JavaScript engine. Node JS is a running environment of JavaScript.JavaScript follows the standards of the JavaScript programming language.Node JS can write in C++ and provide an environment for the written JavaScript program to run on its browser.In a web application, JavaScript is used to perform client-side operations, including web page display, business validation process, and Ajax calls. On the other hand, Node JS is used in web pages for non-blocking accessibility and OS execution.

                                <p>JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard set of claims to share security information or authorization/authentication requests between a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm by the tokenâ€™s issuer to ensure that No one could alter the claims after the token is issued and later can be used by the receiving party to verify the token.A JWT is a Base64URL encoded string, split into three sections, delimited by periods.</p>

                                <p>1.Section one is the header. This section contains JWT metadata; typically information about the type of token and the algorithm used to sign it. It is encoded JSON.</p>
                                <p>2.Section two is the payload. This is the content of the token and is also encoded JSON.</p>
                                <p>3.Section three is the signature. This is the SHA256 (or some other HMAC) hash of the encoded header, encoded payload, and a secret. This part of the JWT is used to verify the integrity of the message.</p>
